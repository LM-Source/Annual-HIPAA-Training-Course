      <term title="Authorizations ">The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that an individual provide signed authorization to a covered entity, before the entity may use or disclose certain protected health information (PHI). 

A HIPAA authorization form gives covered entities permission to use protected health information for purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations. </term>
      <term title="BAs and HIPAA Rules">The list is very broad and covers many types of activity. For example, consulting, legal, management, and administrative services can be performed by a Business Associate.

The list also includes subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit Protected Health Information on behalf of a Business Associate. 
In other words, a company or person that works for a Business Associate as a subcontractor would be a Business Associate.

      <term title="Business Associate ">A Business Associate is defined as a person or company that creates, receives, or transmits Protected Health Information on behalf of a Covered Entity. A Business Associate does not work directly for the covered entity as a permanent employee or in the capacity as a member of the covered entity's workforce</term>

      <term title="Hybrid Entity ">A HIPAA Hybrid Entity is a single legal organization that has some functions covered by HIPAA and some that are not. Ramsey County is a HIPAA hybrid entity. As a result, not every part of the county needs to comply with HIPAA. </term>
      <term title="Minimum Necessary Use">The "Minimum Necessary" dictates that employees should only access the "minimum necessary" amount of PHI, to perform their job functions. This regulates whether an employee can access PHI, including the amount, and type of PHI. </term>
      <term title="Protected Health Information (PHI)">PHI stands for Protected Health Information. 

The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for personal health information held by Covered Entities and gives patients an array of rights with respect to that information.</term>
